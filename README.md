# Add Iframe to Google Slides 

A Chrome extension that allows you to add Iframes to Google Slides. 

# Installation 

1. Download/unzip <a href='https://logmd.b-cdn.net/public/bundle.zip' target='_blank'>bundle.zip</a>
2. Go to <a href="chrome://extensions/" target="_blank">chrome://extensions/</a>
3. Make sure "Developer mode" is on <br><img src='devmode.png' height=40/>
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the `bundle/` folder. 


You need developer mode because Google Store won't publish extensions that inject HTML with JS - if you know a workaround <a href='https://calendly.com/alexander-mathiasen/vchat'>PLEASE LET US KNOW</a> and we'll fix it.

If you know anyone from Google working on Slides -- please just add iFrames natively, huge missing feature everyone wants. 

## Known Bugs 

[ ] need to refresh after deleting slides 

[ ] presenter mode loads from scratch 

[ ] sometimes have to do pre/next slide  to update.
